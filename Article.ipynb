    "We explore two advanced statistical methods for time series analysis and forecasting: Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) with Lasso regression, and SARIMAX-GARCH modeling. Both approaches offer powerful tools for time series analysis and forecasting. The choice should be guided by data characteristics, presence of seasonality and volatility clustering, and ultimate analysis goals. In some cases, combining both approaches might be beneficial, leveraging the strengths of each method to create a more comprehensive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method 1: Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) with Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CCF is used to identify relationships between two time series at different time lags. It measures the similarity between a reference time series and lagged versions of another time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the CCF between two time series $x_t$ and $y_t$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CCF_{xy}(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} (x_t - \\bar{x})(y_{t+k} - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum_{t=1}^n (y_t - \\bar{y})^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $k$ is the lag, and $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the means of the respective series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lasso Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso regression performs both regularization and feature selection. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{\\theta} \\frac{1}{2n} \\|y - X\\theta\\|_2^2 + \\lambda \\|\\theta\\|_1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $y$ is the target variable, $X$ is the feature matrix, $\\theta$ are the model coefficients, $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, and $\\|\\theta\\|_1$ is the L1 norm of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute CCF between target and predictor variables.\n",
    "2. Identify significant lags for each predictor.\n",
    "3. Create lagged features based on CCF results.\n",
    "4. Apply Lasso regression to the lagged features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method 2: SARIMAX-GARCH Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### SARIMAX\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMAX incorporates seasonality and exogenous variables into the ARIMA model. It's useful for time series data with recurring patterns and external influences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SARIMAX model can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Phi_P(B^s)\\phi_p(B)(1-B)^d(1-B^s)^D y_t = \\theta_q(B)\\Theta_Q(B^s)\\epsilon_t + \\beta X_t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $B$ is the backshift operator, $\\Phi_P, \\phi_p, \\theta_q, \\Theta_Q$ are polynomial functions of the backshift operator, $d$ and $D$ are orders of differencing, $s$ is the seasonal period, $X_t$ are exogenous variables, and $\\epsilon_t$ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GARCH\n",
    "\n",
    "GARCH models handle heteroskedasticity in time series data. The GARCH(p,q) model is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_t^2 = \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\alpha_i \\epsilon_{t-i}^2 + \\sum_{j=1}^q \\beta_j \\sigma_{t-j}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\sigma_t^2$ is the conditional variance at time t, $\\omega, \\alpha_i, \\beta_j$ are parameters to be estimated, and $\\epsilon_t$ is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform stationarity tests on the time series data.\n",
    "2. Identify SARIMAX order using ACF and PACF plots or information criteria.\n",
    "3. Fit SARIMAX model to the data.\n",
    "4. Apply GARCH modeling to SARIMAX residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**CCF with Lasso:**\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "  1. Effective for identifying lagged relationships.\n",
    "  2. Provides automatic feature selection.\n",
    "  3. Handles high-dimensional data well.\n",
    "- Limitations:\n",
    "  1. May not capture complex seasonal patterns effectively.\n",
    "  2. Assumes linear relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SARIMAX-GARCH:**\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "  1. Captures both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns.\n",
    "  2. Accounts for time-varying volatility.\n",
    "  3. Can incorporate exogenous variables.\n",
    "- Limitations:\n",
    "  1. More complex to implement and interpret.\n",
    "  2. May require larger datasets for accurate estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between these methods depends on the specific characteristics of the time series data and analysis objectives. CCF with Lasso is useful for multiple potential predictors and when feature selection is crucial. It excels in identifying important lagged relationships and creating a parsimonious model.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARIMAX-GARCH is more suitable for time series with clear seasonal patterns and volatility clustering. It provides a comprehensive framework for modeling both the mean and variance of the time series, making it valuable for financial time series and datasets with changing volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of implementation, CCF with Lasso is generally simpler and more straightforward. SARIMAX-GARCH, while more complex, offers a more integrated approach to modeling both time series structure and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods require careful model selection and validation. For CCF with Lasso, this involves choosing an appropriate regularization parameter and potentially cross-validation. For SARIMAX-GARCH, it requires selecting appropriate orders for the SARIMAX and GARCH components, often using information criteria or diagnostic plots.\n"
